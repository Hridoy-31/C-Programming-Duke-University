For this assignment, you will be practicing writing, compiling, and
running code.  You should write a C file, called hello.c, with a main
function that uses the printf function to print the message

Hello World

[be sure to include a newline!]

Your program should return EXIT_SUCCESS to indicate that it was successful
(the return value of main indicates success [0] or failure [anything else]).

Don't forget to include stdio.h (for printf) and stdlib.h (for
EXIT_SUCCESS).

When you are done, compile your code and run it.
The submit it for grading.
