Congratulations! You have finsihed the project for Course 4 (and hopefully
the entire Specialization).

At this point, you have solid programming fundementals to build from.
(and in fact, if you want to add more fancy features to your project
[wild cards? folded hands? strange poker variants?] you could do it.)

Hopefully you are hungry to learn more programming.  Where can you go from here?

We recommend "Object Oriented Programming in Java":

      https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming

  which is a Coursera Specialization brought to you jointly by Duke
  and  University of California San Diego.  This specialization assumes
  you have good programming fundementals (which you do from this specialization),
  and teaches you Java and Object Orientated Programming (Drew is also
  one of the instructors on two of hte courser).

If you really want to learn a LOT more programming from Drew and Geneveive,
you could think about coming to Duke and studying in the ECE department.
Duke ECE has great undergraduate and Masters programs with excellent
courses on programming!

Whatever you choose to do, we wish you good luck and happy programming!
